    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Ropa vieja is a traditional Cuban dish that is made with shredded beef,
      vegetables, and spices. The name "ropa vieja" translates to "old clothes"
      in Spanish, which is a reference to the shredded appearance of the beef.
      This dish is typically served with rice, black beans, and plantains, and
      is a popular meal in many Cuban households.
